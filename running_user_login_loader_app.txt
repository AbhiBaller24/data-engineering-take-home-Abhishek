1. Complete every step under Project Setup in the README.md file except do NOT run 'make stop'
2. make sure to have following python libraries (I use conda package manager but 'pip install' works too):
    - pandas
    - psycopg2
    - json
3. run the following command in command line: python user_login_loader.py
   (For certain OS's python3 works instead of python)
